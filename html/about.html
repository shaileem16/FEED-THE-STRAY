                <p> At the begining,the drive to start a web page like this was solely driven by self interest but along the path i got to meet similar kind harted people who carried the same interest and had drive to make it into a bigger campaign thats the way we are able to present you the website called "feed the stray".
                    <br>
                 The website "feed the stray" is a non-profitable organization which helps to feed the stray or street animals including dog,cat,birds,ant,cow and many more.Our only goal is to save animals and provide them good shelter as well healthy enviroment to survive.
                 <br>
                To do that we need a lot of support as well as funds i hope everyone will join hands to satand for those who cant speaks but love selflessly.</p>
